# Pulsar-Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework that allows supervised feedforward neural networks to be trained and applied to a variety of problems. Cuurently allows the implementation of Fully-Connected (Dense), Convolutional and Pooling layers, utilising either Logistic Sigmoid or ReLU activation functions.
